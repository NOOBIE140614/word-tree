You are given a rotation angle and your task is to draw the four corner points of a square that is rotated by that amount. This is a structured prediction task where the output is a set, since there is no inherent ordering to the four points. Such sets are a natural representation for many kinds of data, ranging from the set of points in a point cloud, to the set of objects in an image object detection, to the set of nodes in a molecular graph (molecular generation). Yet, existing machine learning models often struggle to solve even the simple square prediction task. The main difficulty in predicting sets comes from the ability to permute the elements in a set freely, which means that there are n! equally good solutions for a set of size n. Models that do not take this set structure into account properly such as MLPs or RNNs result in discontinuities, which is the reason why they struggle to solve simple toy set prediction tasks [30]. We give background on what the problem is in section.How can we build a model that properly respects the set structure of the problem so that we can predict sets without running into discontinuity issues? In this paper, we aim to address this question. Concretely, we contribute the following.
