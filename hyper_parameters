Word tree:
        context aware traversal 
        
        (3 words history vs 7 words history)(batch_size )
        word_embedding lenght = 365
        
        updating a few neurons at a time.
        torch

        
        
        
traversal  at (infrence time ):

    single branch :
        follow the max context agreement
        
    multi brach :
        (How to select and destroy branches ?)
        take top n = {3,5} context branching options (above an threshold)
        recusicely travrse all branches
        select brach based on moving avrage of context agreement
        
        default (tops 5 ,with depth 3)
        
        
get and set
        
update at training :
    context_pathL_length

    weight += 1 / ln(update_count) * gradient
    
    
    
contrastive learning :

ignore other sibling connections during training

    
    
character level connection mapping
